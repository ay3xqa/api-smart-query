# Comprehend Frontend

A modern, elegant Next.js frontend for the Comprehend API intelligence platform. Upload OpenAPI specifications and interact with your APIs using AI-powered insights.

## Features

- Clean, modern UI with dark gray background and sapphire blue accents
- Drag-and-drop file upload for OpenAPI JSON specifications
- Real-time feedback and validation
- Integration with GraphQL backend and S3 storage
- Responsive design with shadcn/ui components

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Backend GraphQL server running
- AWS S3 bucket configured

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the frontend directory:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4000/graphql
```

Note: The frontend no longer requires AWS credentials. File uploads are handled using presigned URLs generated by the backend GraphQL API, which improves security by keeping AWS credentials server-side only.

### Running the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```
